React front-end, C# back-end, with database, and APIs.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
User authorization (more user roles), expanded data visualization (graphs and charts via API), and explore accepting data via text file uploads.
